# brenSDL
An example (and POC) project showcasing the usage of BRender v1.1.2 with the SDL framework. This also works with the fixed-point and floating-point versions of BRender. The project is currently pretty messy, but feel free to look around.

This come prepackaged with modern versions of BRender v1.1.2 built using [my fork of BRender v1.1.2 with CMake support](https://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL2-devel-2.0.22-VC.zip).

In order to build, you must have CMake, MSVC and the SDL2 VC development libraries, the contents inside the SDL folder in the archive need to be extracted into the `sdl2` folder.
